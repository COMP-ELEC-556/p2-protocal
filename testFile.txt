The five-star red flag fluttered in the wind, how loud the victory song was;
Singing our dear motherland, from now on, we are prosperous and strong.
Sing our dear motherland, from now on to prosperity and prosperity.
Over the mountains, across the plains, across the Pentium Yellow River and the Yangtze River;
the vast and beautiful land is our dear hometown.33
